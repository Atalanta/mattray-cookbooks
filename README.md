Description
===========
These cookbooks are not yet part of the Opscode repository for various reasons, so they are officially "unsupported".

Cookbooks
=========
chrony
------
Configures the time synchronization application `chrony` as a client or master timeserver, maintaining the accuracy of the system clock (similar to NTP). Isolated networks are supported as well.

one-shot
--------
This cookbook provides a framework for making single-use, one-shot recipes. By including the `one-shot` recipe in the node's run_list, on the next chef-client run the contents of the `one-shot::one-shot` recipe will be called. This is parameterized as an attribute, so you can change these out by setting the `["one_shot"]["recipe"]` to include different recipes. The file `roles/one-shot.rb` is included so you can simply change the role instead of changing the source directly.
